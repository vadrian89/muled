# Muled
A mule to do the heavy lifting and help with software deployment on Linux distributions.   
This is in no way developed to replace existing projects, but to offer diversity in choices.   
The scripts are in no way tied to any license, anyone is free to use them as they see fit and they come with no guarantee
that they will work.  
Main targets are Qt applications but the scripts can be adapted for other languages and frameworks.
